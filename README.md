## Description 
BingeBuddy is made to help fellow movie lovers find new and random movies. We have also spent countless hours, just scrolling through streaming apps trying to find something new and good. Thats what BingeBuddy is for, as soon as you load into the page you are greeted with 5 completely random movies! If you wish to narrow down the fields based on genres, you can with a few clicks of your mouse. We all know that the weather affects the type of movies we want to watch. Thats why we have a special feature that allows you to enter your location, and get a movie selection based on the weather. Not only do we give you movie ideas, but you can also go to the BuddyReview page, create an account and share and view movie reviews. Heres a sneakpeek of the three pages: [BingeBuddy](BingeBuddyScreenShots/BingeBuddy.jpeg)...  [BuddyLogin](BingeBuddyScreenShots/BuddyLogin.jpeg)...
